# Evolution in disordered quantum systems
 
 #### This project aims to provide the user the ability to visualise the time evolution of a quantum system in a disordered system of arbitrary potential. The user has the ability to add a Gaussian wavepacket with a set momentum and shape to a landscape of a given length and 'resolution'. In its current form, an arbitrary potential can be added to this landscape by the piecewise addition of various curves - this allows for the visualisation of the time evolution of this Gaussian curve in this potential. In addition, one can then perturb the potential by specifying an amount of disorder (and the spacing of this disorder), which allow the visualisation of 'Anderson localisation'.

Installisation is simple and requires cloning this repository and installing the packages in the requirements.txt file.

For guided examples, see the examples.py file.
