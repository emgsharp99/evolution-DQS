# Evolution in disordered quantum systems
 
 #### This project aims to provide the user the ability to visualise the time evolution of a quantum system in a disordered system of arbitrary potential. The user has the ability to add a Gaussian wavepacket with a set momentum and shape to a landscape of a given length and 'resolution'. In its current form, an arbitrary potential can be added to this landscape by the piecewise addition of various curves, allowing for the visualisation of the time evolution of the Gaussian curve in this potential. In addition, one can then perturb the potential by specifying an amount of disorder (and the spacing of this disorder), which allows the user to see the phenomenon of 'Anderson localisation'. The programme is designed to run on a Windows machine.

Installisation is simple and requires cloning this repository and installing the packages in the requirements.txt file.

For a guided example, see the examples.py file. Below are some a few animations which show the potential of this software. In particular we see: a free particle, a particle in infinite square well, a quantum harmonic osciallator, and a perturbed quantum harmonic oscilaltor. <b> More animations can be seen in the <i>
Animations <i/> folder in the repository. </b>
